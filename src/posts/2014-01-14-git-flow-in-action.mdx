I created a test repository on Github to check if git-flow can aid in keeping a clean branch model. In the steps below you can see how I create a new feature and release containing our new feature.

1. Create remote repository on Github
2. Clone de remote repo with `git clone`
3. Init git flow with defaults:
    ` git flow init -d `

    result:
    >Using default branch names.
    >
    >Which branch should be used for bringing forth production releases?
    >   - master
    >Branch name for production releases: [master]

4. When the previous command is finished the develop branch is automatically created and checked out. all I have to do is push the new branch, so it's also available on Github. `git push origin develop`
5. Create new feature with git flow:
    `git flow feature start cats `

    result:
    >Switched to a new branch 'feature/cats'
    >
    >Summary of actions:
    >
    >- A new branch 'feature/cats' was created, based on 'develop'
    >- You are now on branch 'feature/cats'
    >
    >Now, start committing on your feature. When done, use:
    >
    >git flow feature finish cats
6. Publish feature to Github `git flow feature publish cats`

    result:

    >Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    >
    >To https://github.com/alexanderjeurissen/gitFlowTest.git
    >
    > * [new branch]      feature/cats -> feature/cats
    >
    >Already on 'feature/cats'

    >Summary of actions:
    >
    >- A new remote branch 'feature/cats' was created
    >- The local branch 'feature/cats' was configured to track the remote branch
    >- You are now on branch 'feature/cats'
7. Create txt file named cats.txt `touch cats.txt`
8. Start tracking cats.txt `git add cats.txt`
9. Commit cats.txt to feature branch `git commit -m "add cats"`
10. I'm finished with this feature to close this feature i can use the following command: `git flow feature finish cats`

    result:
    >Switched to branch 'develop'
    >
    >Updating 00ebac7..062549e
    >
    >Fast-forward
    >
    > cats.txt | 0

    >
    > If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D feature/cats'.
    >
    >Summary of actions:

    >- The feature branch 'feature/cats' was merged into 'develop'
    >- Feature branch 'feature/cats' has been removed
    >- You are now on branch 'develop'

11. As you can see git-flow checked out the develop branch it then merged the feature/cats branch into 'develop' and tried to remove the feature branch. However it aborted finishing the feature because the feature isn't committed to Github yet.
12. first i need to push the feature branch with `git push origin feature/cats`

    result:
    >counting objects: 4, done.
    >
    >Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
    >
    >Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
    >
    >Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 282 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.

    >
    >To https://github.com/alexanderjeurissen/gitFlowTest.git
    >
    >   00ebac7..062549e  feature/cats -> feature/cats

13. now i need to checkout the feature branch and finish it with: `git flow feature finish cats`

    result:

    >Switched to branch 'develop'
    >Already up-to-date.
    >Deleted branch feature/cats (was 062549e).
    >
    >Summary of actions:
    >
    >- The feature branch 'feature/cats' was merged into 'develop'
    >- Feature branch 'feature/cats' has been removed
    >- You are now on branch 'develop'

14. I think it's time for a new release, to start a release i use: `git flow release start 1.0`

    result:
    >Switched to a new branch 'release/1.0'
    >
    >Summary of actions:
    >
    >- A new branch 'release/1.0' was created, based on 'develop'
    >- You are now on branch 'release/1.0'
    >
    >Follow-up actions:
    >
    >- Bump the version number now!
    >- Start committing last-minute fixes in preparing your release
    >- When done, run:
    >
    >git flow release finish '1.0'
15. There are no last-minute fixes so let's finish the release with : `git flow release finish 1.0` this asks me for both a merge commit message and a tag commit message.

    result:

    ```sh
    Switched to branch 'master'

    Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.

     cats.txt | 0

     1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

     create mode 100644 cats.txt

    Deleted branch release/1.0 (was 062549e).

    Summary of actions:

    - Latest objects have been fetched from 'origin'
    - Release branch has been merged into 'master'
    - The release was tagged '1.0'
    - Release branch has been back-merged into 'develop'
    - Release branch 'release/1.0' has been deleted
    ```

16. And it's done our release is a fact. if i run `git branch` now only the master and develop branch are left.
